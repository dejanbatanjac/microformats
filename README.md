# microformats

Microformats WordPress theme uses two worlds.

World 1. Fixed size layout.

World 2. A responsive technique of scaling to fit the browser width when the browser width is less than 800px.

The main theme idea is to support Article microformats for your posts.


You can test the article microformats from here:
https://developers.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/ (on this URL https://programming-review.com/find-grep/ for example).

It supports 500+ Google fonts and custom colors. (More it supports custom site icon, custom header, and custom background image as other themes do).

It is based on the Underscores theme. http://underscores.me/

It should have 0 errors when tested using the Theme check plugin. Tested using the theme unit test data https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test.

You can download it from this link: (microformats WordPress theme).

The theme is light and easy to use.

What is little strange about this theme? Well, it doesnâ€™t show the header once you are visiting posts. This will focus the reader on the text.
